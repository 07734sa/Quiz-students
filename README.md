# Student Quiz
First submission assignment in the JavaScript course.

## Assignment
Create a game where you try to guess your classmate. The game should display one image and four names, with one of the names being correct

The same name should not appear more than once per image.
The position of the correct name should be randomized, but the image should remain the same. The array of students was not allowed to be modified.

## Hygiene requirements

✅ Be responsive (mobile-first, at least 3 different breakpoints).

✅ Use flexbox or CSS grid in a semantically correct way.

✅ All data and status should be in JavaScript, meaning the DOM should not be used as the "single point of truth."

✅ All source code must be version-controlled in Git.

✅ The game must be published on Netlify.
